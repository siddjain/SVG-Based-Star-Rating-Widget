This is a SVG based star rating widget. The demo files show how to use the widget. The widget can be customised to provide:
- custom fill color
- custom number of stars
- custom captions (good, bad, ugly etc.)
- can be disabled to display a static rating, in which case nothing will happen on mouse hover in/out or click
